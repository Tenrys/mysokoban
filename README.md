# mysokoban

School project for [LaPlateforme.io](https://laplateforme.io).

Just a simple Sokoban game.

[Demo](https://tenrys.pw/ShareX/2021/Apr/L9zy.mp4)

## How to Run

Install dependencies:

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then just run the main script in the directory where `__main__.py` is located:

`$ python .`

## Notes

It's possible to create other levels easily using [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) but there's no such thing as progressing through the game at the moment, with only one level available.

I used a virtual environment to develop this.

I would say it took me 6 hours to make in total. I was expected to spend a week on it, lol...

## Libraries

See `requirements.txt`.
